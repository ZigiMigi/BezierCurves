# BezierCurves
## About
In this project i wrote and created a web app that let's it's users create and edit Bezier curve's. By creating multiple continious curves it creates a composite BÃ©zier curve (or Spline). Users can change curve's color, move the curve's or even change their points.   
![](https://github.com/ZigiMigi/BezierCurves/blob/main/bizeirShots/bizeirCurves.png)  
The curve's are made by draging the mouse across the canvas. 
1. The first click will create an interpolated point,
2. then you drag to the wanted possition and let go of the mouse button,
3. the point where the mouse button was let go, will create an approximated point.  
###
Bellow the canvas there are 2 button's. One will allow you to start drawing a new spline and the other will allow you to move currently created point's on the canvas.  
By creating new Splines there will also apear a new editing button with the splines name bellow the canvas.  
In that editing section you can change colors and delete curves that are drawn.
